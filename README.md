# OpenFlow Next Generation - watchdog

This is a component of of-ng project. This component is responsible for collect
statistics about the flows installed on switches and generate `rrd` files for future plotting.

Currently this only supports OpenDaylight, but the idea is that this component
should be controller independent.

This project uses the `python-odl` library to communicate with OpenDaylight.

$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/src/of-ng/
